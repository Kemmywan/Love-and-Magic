Absolutely! Here’s a straightforward, step-by-step guide to set up a **conda environment** for your `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook), install all necessary packages, and activate the environment so you can run your cell code.

---

## Step 1: Open Terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows)

---

## Step 2: Create a New Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n d2l-notebook python=3.11
```
- You can name the environment whatever you like (here, `d2l-notebook`).
- This will install Python 3.11.

---

## Step 3: Activate the Environment

```bash
conda activate d2l-notebook
```

---

## Step 4: Install Required Packages

```bash
# Install Jupyter Notebook
conda install jupyter notebook

# Install PyTorch (CPU version, adjust for GPU if needed)
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch

# Install d2l and any other packages (use pip for d2l)
pip install d2l
```

---

## Step 5: (Optional) Install Additional Packages

If you need any other libraries (e.g., matplotlib, pandas), install them now:
```bash
conda install matplotlib pandas
```

---

## Step 6: Register the Environment as a Jupyter Kernel

This allows you to select your environment in Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name d2l-notebook --display-name "Python (d2l-notebook)"
```
- Now you’ll see **Python (d2l-notebook)** as an option in Jupyter.

---

## Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open your `.ipynb` file and, at the top of the notebook (toolbar), select **Kernel > Change kernel > Python (d2l-notebook)**.

---

## Step 8: Run Your Cell Code

All your imports should now work:

```python
import math
import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.nn import functional as F
from d2l import torch as d2l
```
